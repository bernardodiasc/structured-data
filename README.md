# structured-data

This is a small experiment about handling structured data in `xml` and `json` format.

The XML format uses `xsl` to build the markup, the result is available here https://bernardodiasc.github.io/structured-data/data.xml

I'm looking for a good way to accomplish the same result, easy as in the XML example, but for the JSON. If you know hoew to do, please send a PR!

Its preferably a result that will be able to see on GitHub pages. If you need to include a `data.html` file, go for it. But do not change the `data.xml` and `data.json`, both have the same structure and same data.

Thanks for your attention.
